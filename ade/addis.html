    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 15px; text-indent: 15px;" >The performance group: this group performs usually every week free of charge in open spaces for the community; during the school holidays it tours other regions of Ethiopia. The performance groups also tours  internationally. The 160 boys and girls, in Addis Ababa, Jimma, Mekele, and Nazareth, aged between 8 and 21 years, permanent members of the performing troupes  are all encouraged  to follow their regular schooling  and attend as well tutorial classes provided by the circus. Most come from extremely poor backgrounds: they  receive a transport allowance, their medical needs are covered and meals are offered after long practices and shows.The members come from different background and religious groups. Most of them have been with the Circus right from the start.Accommodation is also provided when needed near the Circus Compound.The circus schools are taught by these youngsters  which provides an income for them.  As well, within the administration structure the older youths have also been trained and hired to support  the functioning of the organization. In fact, the main idea for the organization is to provide a platform for the future of these young  performers: in giving support for their formal education, by providing training opportunities for securing a future for themselves.</p>

            <p>Black lion gymnastics and circus club is know working in AddisAbsba city arada subcity wereda 4 youth center.

                 also the following black lion members where performing a lot of national shows and compititutions 
                 At Fekat Circus we work with a premise in mind: The more people are involved in circus, the better the world becomes, as circus is a powerful platform for positive transformation. Fekat Circus School is a bouncing and colorful place, located in the historical centre of Addis Ababa. The space vibrates with children and youngsters jumping, juggling, tumbling, and dancing. The main circus disciplines taught are acrobatics, balance acts (hand stand, ladder, rola-bola), Chinese pole, contortion, human pyramid, different juggling arts (balls, clubs, diabolo, hat, hula-hoop, ring, poas, etc.), and aerial arts. We have added creative lab as a new activity in the school programme.</p>
